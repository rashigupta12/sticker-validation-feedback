# sticker-validation-eedback
 I developed a full-stack sticker validation and feedback dashboard using Next.js and MongoDB, with authentication and authorization. It features admin and user portals, where admins assign languages for users to validate. Users mark fields like "Political" and "Religious," and feedback is stored in MongoDB, aiding admins in making approval decisions.
